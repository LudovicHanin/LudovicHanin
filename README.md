I'm currently a student in Gameplay Programming but I also specialized in Tool Programming.                                                                               
I've work as programmer on a Rogue-like playable on Steam : https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966110/Greed/
My last personnal project is a game of Hide and Tag mixing the Hide and Seek game et and Tag game. This is a multiplayer online game where I will include many mechanics of movement to create fun parkour for the player with jump boost, speed boost, wall jump...
